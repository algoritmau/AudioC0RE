## Challenge 1: Proof of Concept

Here's a link to the [original publication](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-challenge-1/).

Here are the challenges for the first sprint:

- Build a proof of concept (POC) Gatsby site to test their routing API, builds service, hosting, and Contentful integration.

- Use Gatsby’s Contentful plugin and connect to a test Contentful site.

- Create the following pages:

  - home

  - about

  - and a collection of pages for every city we’re in.

- Build it on Gatsby Cloud and use their preview URL.

- Don’t worry about content or styling – this is only a POC. You can display the title of the page on a white background. That is enough for now.
